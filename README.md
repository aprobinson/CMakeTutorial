=============

This branch shows the most basic build system that one can set up for the
HelloWorld project. Using the build system, the main executable can be created.
However, attempting to build the executable with MPI will result in linker
errors because the build system is not yet set up to link against external
libraries. 

An install script was also added, which helps out with the configuration and
build process. Checkout `python install.py --help`.

Ok, sweet, we have a `--no-mpi` flag. So we *can* make and run main with:

```
python install.py --no-mpi
./build/src/main
```

Note that you may have to include the --replace flag to build from scratch.

Check out branch step2 to see how one sets up the build system to link against
the external MPI libraries.
